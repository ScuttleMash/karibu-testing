Simulates a Vaadin 14 + npm + webpack setup, by having
a specially placed [flow-build-info.json](src/main/resources/META-INF/VAADIN/config/flow-build-info.json)
file. Under normal circumstances this file is generated by Maven Vaadin plugin,
but in this project we pretend that it has been generated.
